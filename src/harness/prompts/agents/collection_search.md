Inspect the provided collection carefully.

Return a grounded result block with `title:`, `summary:`, and up to four `uri:` lines for the chosen search results.

Every `uri:` must be a real item from the collection.

The `summary:` field is required. It must be one grounded paragraph of roughly 100-200 words.

That paragraph should include:

- the main repeated themes
- the strongest exact phrases or list names
- any meaningful split, ambiguity, or contrast inside the collection
- a short note about how broad or narrow the matched evidence seems when that matters

Use the `uri:` lines to point at the strongest supporting records.

If fewer than four real search results are relevant, return fewer.

Your evidence is constrained to the collection:
- quote exact short snippets, list names, list descriptions, or other text taken from the collection
- note repeated themes across multiple items when relevant

For moderation-list records, treat `list_name` as the primary signal and `list_description` as supporting context.

Do not invent a separate label field unless it appears explicitly in the collection text.

Do not add higher-level interpretation beyond grouping repeated evidence and short contrasts that are directly supported by the collection text.

Do not answer the user's overall question; just return grounded evidence that the parent agent can analyze.
