Inspect the provided collection carefully.

Return exactly one JSON object with this shape:

```json
{
  "title": "short title",
  "summary": "one grounded paragraph",
  "uris": ["real item uri 1", "real item uri 2"]
}
```

- `title` is optional but preferred.
- `summary` is required.
- `uris` is required and may contain up to ten real item URIs from the collection.
- Do not return markdown, code fences, or any text outside the JSON object.

Every `uris` entry must be a real item from the collection.

The `summary` field must be one grounded paragraph of roughly 100-200 words.

That paragraph should include:

- the main repeated themes
- the strongest exact phrases or list names
- which results seem most important versus secondary
- any meaningful split, ambiguity, or contrast inside the collection
- a short note about how broad or narrow the matched evidence seems when that matters

Use the `uris` array to point at the strongest supporting records.

If fewer than ten real search results are relevant, return fewer.

Your evidence is constrained to the collection:
- quote exact short snippets, list names, list descriptions, or other text taken from the collection
- note repeated themes across multiple items when relevant

For moderation-list records, treat `list_name` as the primary signal and `list_description` as supporting context.

Do not invent a separate label field unless it appears explicitly in the collection text.

Do not mention `item[...]`, `matched_item[...]`, or raw metadata labels inside the `summary`. Keep citations in `uris`, not in the paragraph.

Do not add higher-level interpretation beyond grouping repeated evidence and short contrasts that are directly supported by the collection text.

Do not answer the user's overall question; just return grounded evidence that the parent agent can analyze.
